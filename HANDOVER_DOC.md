## 0. Naming (renamed 2026-09-27)

The project is an IDP; the feature flag service is one workload running on it. The old
`ff-idp` prefix implied otherwise, so everything was renamed. Older notes/transcripts use the
old names.

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| repo `ff-idp-infra` | `idp-infra` |
| repo `feature-flag-service-env-config` | `idp-gitops` |
| repo `Feature-Flag-Service` | `feature-flag-service` |
| repo `idp-portal` | unchanged |
| AWS prefix `ff-idp-*`, secrets `ff-idp/*`, tag `Project=ff-idp`, ALB group `ff-idp` | `idp-*`, `idp/*`, `Project=idp`, `idp` |
| state bucket `ff-idp-tfstate-693906847772`, table `ff-idp-tf-locks` | `idp-tfstate-693906847772`, `idp-tf-locks` |
| CI roles `ff-idp-github-ci`, `ff-idp-service-ci` | `idp-github-ci`, `idp-service-ci` |
| AWS profile `ff-idp`, IAM user `ff-idp-admin`, laptop secrets dir `~/.ff-idp` | `idp`, `idp-admin`, `~/.idp` |
| GitHub owner `DSurya11` (personal) | GitHub org **`surya-idp`** (id 334455734, Free; user DSurya11 is admin). All 4 repos transferred 2026-09-27, same repo IDs (F16) |
| GitHub Apps `ff-idp-ci-bot`, `ff-idp-backstage` | renamed 2026-09-27 by the user in the GitHub UI (to `idp-ci-bot` / `idp-backstage` as suggested; confirm). IDs unchanged. Still to do: bot `git config user.name` in both CI workflows (use the token action's `app-slug` output), comments, secrets `FF_IDP_CI_BOT_*` |

The old state bucket and lock table were detached from 00-bootstrap state (not destroyed) as a
backup. Delete them after the first successful `make up` on the new bucket. `verify-empty`
scans both `Project=idp` and `Project=ff-idp` tags.

## 0a. Current State at a Glance (2026-09-27, end of Session 6)

**AWS right now:** everything destroyed except the free permanent layers (00-bootstrap,
10-network, 15-registry). `make verify-empty` passes: $0.00. Neon was retired 2026-09-27
(Finding 51); RDS is the only database.

| Step | Status |
|---|---|
| 1-22 (app, kind platform, Terraform bootstrap, network, data, CI rewrite) | Done |
| 23 EKS, 24 ESO, 25 ALB ingress | Done and verified |
| 26 Argo CD app-of-apps via Terraform, 27 Kustomize overlays | Done and verified 2026-09-26 |
| 28 HPA + PDB + zero-downtime rollouts (0 failed requests under load) | Done and verified 2026-09-26 |
| 29 Backstage in the cluster (image via CI, RDS, GitHub App) | Done and verified 2026-09-27 |
| 30 Software template `python-service` | Live demo done 2026-09-27: form -> running in 5m31s (~2 min machine time) |
| 31 plugins, 33 Kyverno suite, 34 observability, 35 DR drill, 36 e2e rewrite | Not started |

**How a session works:** `make up` (~21-27 min, creates 20-data -> 30-cluster -> 40-platform;
Argo CD then deploys everything from idp-gitops) -> work -> `make down` (~16 min, must exit 0).
Cost while up: ~$0.26/hr (~$0.80 per 3-hour session, section 3).

**Delivery chain (verified end to end):** push to an app repo -> CI (tests, arm64 image,
Trivy gate, push to ECR via OIDC) -> CI bot commits the new tag to idp-gitops -> Argo CD
auto-syncs -> rolling update with zero dropped requests.

**Session 6 (2026-09-27) summary:** Step 29 verified; Step 30 built (template, narrow CI role
`idp-service-ci`, GitHub App `ff-idp-backstage`, credentials from `~/.idp`); project renamed
ff-idp -> idp (section 0, Finding 50); Terraform state locking turned on (Finding 49);
CI hardened (Finding 48 fixed); stale `argocd/application.yaml` and old catalog data removed
from feature-flag-service.

**Session 7 offline work (2026-09-27, after make down):** PLATFORM_REVIEW section 5a has the status.
Done: idp-gitops ruleset + `validate` required check (F2), lock files (F6), IaC CI (F7), SHA-pinned
actions + Dependabot + CodeQL + secret scanning (F11), PAT secret deleted (F8), old ff-idp bucket/table
deleted, Apps renamed (bot now commits as `idp-ci-bot[bot]`). Prepared as DRAFT PRs (need a cluster):
AppProjects + PSA (F4/F5), ESO 2.11.0 + v1 API (F10), terraform plan/drift CI (F7). Merge order and
manual steps: section 16b. **idp-gitops main is protected: humans change it only through PRs.**

**Read `PLATFORM_REVIEW.md` (this repo) before new work.** It maps every part of the platform
against industry practice (sourced) and ranks 16 flaws. The top ones: a long-lived admin access key on
the laptop (F1), idp-gitops main unprotected (F2), apps using the RDS master user (F3), everything in
the `default` Argo AppProject and no Pod Security Admission/Kyverno (F4, F5), no observability
(F14). Its section 5 is the merged work order. The user's rule: where we differ from industry
without a real reason, follow industry. Open decisions: GitHub org (F16), Identity Center (F1),
the template decisions.

**Templates: read `TEMPLATES_RESEARCH.md` (this repo) before any template work.** The first live
run (2026-09-27) proved the chain but also showed `python-service` v1 is a starter, not a golden
path: dev needs a human merge (G1), **later pushes to a generated service never deploy (G2,
Finding 55)**, and there are no tests, lint, docs, observability or supply-chain controls. That
file has the industry research, the gap matrix, the zero-touch design (ApplicationSet + Argo CD
Image Updater + an await-and-merge scaffolder action) and the phased plan. The user's direction
(2026-09-27): dev must be 100% automated; templates must be industry-grade, not toys.

**Next session:** PLATFORM_REVIEW.md section 5 order (decide F16 first; offline fixes before
cluster time), which includes TEMPLATES_RESEARCH.md phases 1-4. Build and render-test offline; `make up` only to verify. Checklist
in section 16b. The earlier plan (flag helper in the skeleton, Template 2 `add-feature-flag`) is
now phases 3 and 6 of that plan. The one-Location fix (`templates/all-templates.yaml`) is done
(Finding 53): a new template is a git push, no image rebuild.

Small pending items: GitHub Apps were renamed in the UI (section 0); code refs + `IDP_CI_BOT_*`
secrets still to do (needs a new CI bot key). Delete the unused `ENV_CONFIG_REPO_PAT` secret in
feature-flag-service (Step 12 leftover, long-lived PAT; PLATFORM_REVIEW F8).

## 3. Cost Model

### CHOSEN: Option B — Full Destroy Every Session ($0.00 Idle)

User chose Option B on 2026-09-22 after full explanation of tradeoffs:
- Option A: $4.22/month idle (RDS stopped storage + Secrets Manager)
- Option B: $0.00/month idle (full destroy — nothing runs between sessions)

Option B was chosen because ElastiCache has NO stop API (discovered in Step 21), and the
only way to stop paying for it is to destroy it. Once destruction is required anyway, full
destroy of all layers costs nothing extra and is simpler to reason about.

**CRITICAL: skip_final_snapshot = true on RDS**
With Option B (full destroy each session), false = 12 × 20GB × $0.131 = $31.44/month in
orphaned snapshots. Must be true. Set and verified in 20-data/main.tf.

### Per 3-Hour Session (cluster up)
| Component | Calculation | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| EKS control plane | 3hr × $0.10 | $0.30 |
| EC2 t4g.small ×2 | 2 × 3hr × $0.0168 | $0.10 |
| NAT Gateway | 3hr × $0.056 | $0.17 |
| ALB | 3hr × $0.0239 | $0.07 |
| Public IPv4 (~3 IPs) | 3 × 3hr × $0.005 | $0.05 |
| EBS (negligible) | | ~$0.01 |
| RDS db.t3.micro | 3hr × $0.017 | $0.05 |
| ElastiCache Valkey | 3hr × $0.016 | $0.05 |
| Secrets Manager (4-5 secrets, proration) | | ~$0.01 |
| **Session total** | ~$0.26/hr | **~$0.80** (+$0.05 if HPA adds a 3rd node) |

### Monthly (12 sessions/month, 3hr each)
| Component | Monthly |
|---|---|
| Sessions (12 × $0.80) | $9.60 |
| Between sessions | $0.00 (Option B — everything destroyed) |
| ECR (~1GB, kept between sessions) | $0.10 |
| S3 + DynamoDB (state) | ~$0.01 |
| **Monthly total** | **~$9.71** |

### Project Total
- 6 months × $9.71 = ~$58 total
- Credits remaining after project: ~$140
- Verdict: Very comfortable. No need to cut scope.

---

## 4. Cost Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **`make down` before closing the laptop. VERIFY with `make verify-empty`.** Must show OK: $0.00.

2. **CloudWatch log retention = 1 day.** Set everywhere. Default 90-day at $0.50/GB is a silent credit drain.

3. **Option B lifecycle: DESTROY all layers (20-data, 30-cluster, 40-platform) in make down.**
   ElastiCache has NO stop API — the only way to not pay for it is to destroy it.
   RDS also destroyed (not stopped) — simpler, cheaper under Option B.

4. **Tag EVERY resource with `Project=idp`.** Via Terraform `default_tags`. Untagged orphans = surprise bills.

5. **Budget alerts confirmed in place:**
   - `My Zero-Spend Budget`: $1/month alert
   - `Total-180-of-200-Alert`: $180 cumulative over project lifetime

6. **Valkey, not Redis.** `engine = "valkey"` in ElastiCache Terraform. Same API, 20% cheaper.

7. **No paid domain.** Use ALB DNS name directly. Document as "production would use ACM + Route53; deferred."

8. **skip_final_snapshot = true on ALL RDS instances.** With Option B, false = $31/month snapshots.

## 5. Repository State (as of 2026-09-27)

| Repo | Local path | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| [idp-infra](https://github.com/surya-idp/idp-infra) | `~/projects/idp-infra` | Terraform layers, Makefile, `scripts/` (down.sh, verify-empty.py, load-local-secrets.sh), `tests/rollout-load.js`, this doc, `PLATFORM_REVIEW.md`, `TEMPLATES_RESEARCH.md` |
| [idp-gitops](https://github.com/surya-idp/idp-gitops) | `~/projects/idp-gitops` | Everything Argo CD deploys (layout below). Nothing is applied by hand |
| [idp-portal](https://github.com/surya-idp/idp-portal) (public) | `~/projects/idp-portal` | Backstage 1.54 app, its CI, `templates/all-templates.yaml` + `templates/python-service/` |
| [feature-flag-service](https://github.com/surya-idp/feature-flag-service) | `~/projects/feature-flag-service` | The flag API (FastAPI, Alembic), its CI, `catalog-info.yaml` |

Cleaned 2026-09-27: one-off helper scripts, old transcripts, duplicate kubectl/terraform
binaries, committed test `.db` files, the Step 11 `terraform/` folder in feature-flag-service
(later idp-infra/90-legacy-neon, retired 2026-09-27) and Backstage's demo entities/template are gone. The only
untracked file left is feature-flag-service `tests/test_e2e.sh` (kind-era, input for Step 36).
Interview write-ups live outside the repos in `~/projects/to read/`.
Follow-up: feature-flag-service README still describes the kind/Neon/GHCR setup (Section 18).

CI bots only ever change `newTag:` in `apps/*/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml`.

## 6. What Is Done — Steps 1–23 (history; current status is in section 0a)

### Application Layer (Steps 1–9) ✅ All Complete
| Step | What | Key files |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | DB schema: `flags`, `targeting_rules`, `audit_log` (CASCADE/SET NULL) | `alembic/` |
| 2 | `/health` (503 on DB down) + fail-fast startup check | `app/main.py`, `app/routers/health.py` |
| 3 | JWT auth + bcrypt, admin role | `app/auth.py`, `app/dependencies.py` |
| 4 | Flag CRUD + audit logging | `app/routers/flags.py` |
| 5 | `/evaluate`: fail-safe, percentage hash, targeting rules | `app/evaluation.py`, `app/routers/evaluate.py` |
| 6 | Redis caching (shared across replicas, ~0.6ms) | `app/cache.py` |
| 7 | `docker-compose.yml` (local full-stack) | `docker-compose.yml` |
| 8 | Multi-stage Dockerfile (non-root appuser UID 999, HEALTHCHECK) | `Dockerfile` |
| 9 | GitHub Actions CI: test → build → push to GHCR (SHA + latest) | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (rewritten in Step 22) |

### Platform Layer (Steps 10–16) ✅ All Complete
| Step | What | Key files |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | kind cluster, 2-replica deployment, liveness/readiness probes | `idp-gitops/api-deployment.yaml` |
| 11 | Terraform manages Neon (local state, `kislerdm/neon` v0.18.0) | `terraform/main.tf` |
| 12 | App/env-config split; CI auto-updates image SHA via sed + PAT | `ci.yml` lines 261–272 |
| 13 | Argo CD (automated sync, selfHeal, prune); secret-template trap found+fixed | `argocd/application.yaml` |
| 14 | Backstage catalog: Component + 2 Resources | `catalog-info.yaml` |
| 15 | Kyverno `disallow-root-containers` (Enforce) | `kyverno-policy-disallow-root.yaml` |
| 16 | Prometheus + Grafana, ServiceMonitor, 4 custom metrics, latency investigation | `app/metrics.py` |

### Key Findings From Steps 1-16 (Already in README)
1. p95 latency ~0.97s. Redis ~0.6ms. Postgres fetch ~780ms every request.
2. CrashLoopBackOff vs readiness failure — fail-fast startup bypasses probes.
3. Secret-template GitOps trap — Argo CD picks up any `kind: Secret` in watched path.
4. Kyverno optional-match `=(field)` bug — policy looked fine but enforced nothing.
5. CRD size limit → `kubectl apply --server-side`.
6. Argo CD selfHeal fighting manual `kubectl apply`.
7. conntrack stickiness on sequential in-cluster requests (not yet in README — add in Section 14).

### Infrastructure Phase (Steps 17–23) ✅ Complete

#### Step 17 — AWS Account Hygiene ✅
- IAM user idp-admin confirmed (NEVER root)
- Budget alerts confirmed:
  - `My Zero-Spend Budget`: $1/month threshold
  - `Total-180-of-200-Alert`: $180 cumulative
- AWS CLI profile idp working
- Verified: `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile idp` → Account 693906847772

#### Step 18 — Terraform Bootstrap (00-bootstrap) ✅
Applied 2026-09-22. Resources: 9 created. State: LOCAL (intentional).

Resources created:
- **S3 bucket** `idp-tfstate-693906847772`: versioning=Enabled, SSE=AES256, all public access blocked
- **DynamoDB table** `idp-tf-locks`: PAY_PER_REQUEST, hash key LockID
- **GitHub OIDC Provider**: thumbprint fetched dynamically via `tls_certificate` data source (NOT hardcoded — survives GitHub cert rotation)
- **IAM Role** `idp-github-ci`:
  - Trust: StringEquals on `sub` for exact repo + main branch (current subjects: section 11)
  - Trust: StringEquals `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud` = `sts.amazonaws.com`
  - No wildcards anywhere
  - Inline policy: `GetAuthorizationToken` on `*` (AWS requirement — account-level), all other ECR actions scoped to `arn:aws:ecr:ap-south-1:693906847772:repository/feature-flag-service`

#### Step 19 — Neon State Migration (90-legacy-neon) ✅
Applied 2026-09-22. State migrated from local to S3. Neon project untouched.
Retired 2026-09-27 after the A/B finished: project destroyed, layer removed (Finding 51).

#### Step 20 — Network Layer (10-network) ✅
Applied 2026-09-22. Resources: 17 created. Cost: $0/month permanently.
- VPC, 4 subnets (ap-south-1a/b), IGW, route tables, and SGs created permanently ($0/month).

#### Step 21 — Data Layer (20-data) ✅ (Revised Session 3)
Applied and destroyed 2026-09-22. Option B lifecycle: full destroy each session.
- ElastiCache moved to `30-cluster` to allow nightly destruction.
- **Session 3 Fix:** Switched to `db.t3.micro` and `gp2` storage type due to an active AWS capacity shortage for Graviton (`t4g`) databases with `gp3` in Mumbai (`ap-south-1`).

#### Step 22 — CI Rewrite ✅
Committed and pushed 2026-09-22. Commit: 907c464 to feature-flag-service repo.
- CI refactored to use GitHub App for env-config updates, ECR registry, and strictly OIDC auth (no static credentials).

#### Step 23 — EKS Cluster Layer (30-cluster) ✅
- `main.tf` written utilizing `terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws ~> 20.0` (Avoided v21 due to known `var.partition` planning freeze bug).
- **Session 3 Blockers Overcome:**
  - Account strictly blocks non-Free-Tier instance types (like `t3.medium`) from running as SPOT. 
  - Node group configuration altered to `t4g.small` (ARM Graviton) using `ON_DEMAND` capacity.
  - Required specifying `ami_type = "AL2023_ARM_64_STANDARD"` because EKS rejects mismatched architectures.
- Completed in Sessions 4-5: EKS 1.35, t4g.small ON_DEMAND nodes, prefix delegation (maxPods 110), metrics-server add-on.

## 8. Session Lifecycle Commands (Option B — Full Destroy)

### make up (~21-27 min, measured)
```
[1/4] 20-data apply            RDS + 4 secrets (DB password and JWT key generated by Terraform)
      scripts/load-local-secrets.sh
                               ~/.idp/{backstage-app.env, backstage-app.pem, backstage-client-secret}
                               -> idp/backstage-github-app (via stdin; warns and skips if missing)
[2/4] 30-cluster apply         EKS, nodes, NAT, Valkey, IRSA roles
[3/4] aws eks update-kubeconfig --name idp-cluster
[4/4] 40-platform apply        ALB controller, ESO, Argo CD, root app
      then waits (600s) for application/root to be Healthy
```
No manual steps after it: secrets come from ESO, DB migrations run as an Argo CD Sync hook.
Before `make up`: `curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com` must match `allowed_cidr` in
30-cluster/variables.tf (the EKS API is restricted to your IP).

### make down (~16 min) = scripts/down.sh
```
[0/3] delete the root Argo app (cascade -> Ingresses -> the ALB controller deletes the ALB),
      then delete any leftover ALBs / target groups in the VPC
[1/3] destroy 40-platform   [2/3] destroy 30-cluster   [3/3] destroy 20-data
then  verify-empty.py
```
Exits non-zero if ANY step failed. Watch it finish; if interrupted, run it again (Finding 37).

Lost every session: RDS data (flags, users, audit log), secrets, cluster state, Valkey cache.
Survives: permanent layers (section 9), Git, Terraform state, ECR images.

### make verify-empty
`scripts/verify-empty.py`: (1) tagging API for `Project=idp` and `Project=ff-idp`, with free and
pending-deletion resources listed as INFO; (2) direct per-service checks (EKS, EC2, NAT, ELB,
RDS, ElastiCache, Secrets Manager, EIPs...) that do not depend on tags. Exit 0 = $0.00.

## 9. All Permanent AWS Resources (Live Right Now, Never Destroyed)

| **Backups to delete** | S3 ff-idp-tfstate-693906847772, DynamoDB ff-idp-tf-locks (unmanaged since the rename) | - |

All free except ECR storage (~$0.10/GB-month).

## 10. Ephemeral Resources (Destroyed Each Session, Recreated Each make up)

| Resource | Layer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RDS idp-postgres | 20-data | db.t3.micro, PostgreSQL 16, 20GB gp2, SSL enforced (Finding 47) |
| Secret idp/db-creds | 20-data | generated password; url uses psycopg2 driver |
| Secret idp/jwt-secret | 20-data | generated (`random_password`) |
| Secret idp/grafana-admin | 20-data | placeholder (Step 34) |
| Secret idp/backstage-github-app | 20-data | placeholder, filled from `~/.idp` by make up |
| NAT Gateway + EIP | 30-cluster | |
| ElastiCache idp-valkey + secret idp/valkey | 30-cluster | cache.t4g.micro, engine valkey |
| EKS idp-cluster + node group | 30-cluster | 1.35, t4g.small ON_DEMAND |
| IAM roles idp-eso, idp-alb-controller | 30-cluster | IRSA |
| ALB controller, ESO, Argo CD, root app | 40-platform | |
| ALB (IngressGroup `idp`) | created by the ALB controller | deleted by down.sh step 0 |

## 11. CI/CD State

### feature-flag-service (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- `concurrency: ci-<event>-<sha>` (Finding 48).
- `test` (ubuntu-latest, Postgres/Redis services, pytest) on every push and PR.
- `build-and-push` (main only, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`): OIDC -> role idp-github-ci -> skip if the
  SHA tag already exists in ECR -> buildx arm64 push (provenance=false) -> Trivy gate
  (HIGH/CRITICAL with fix = fail; Trivy authenticates to ECR, TRIVY_PLATFORM=linux/arm64).
- `update-env-config`: GitHub App token (ff-idp-ci-bot, repo idp-gitops only) -> set `newTag` in
  `apps/feature-flag-service/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml` -> commit -> push with
  rebase-and-retry (3 tries).

### idp-portal (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
Same shape on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`: yarn install/tsc/build:backend -> docker build -> push unless
the tag exists -> Trivy (local image) -> bot bumps `apps/idp-portal/overlays/dev`.
`concurrency: ci-<sha>`.

### Services created by the python-service template
Their CI (copied from `templates/python-service/skeleton/.github/workflows/ci.yml`) assumes
`idp-service-ci`, creates ECR `svc/<name>` on first run and pushes the image. The deploy
config is added by the template's PR to idp-gitops, pinned to the first commit SHA.

### OIDC trust (00-bootstrap)
`sub` embeds immutable IDs: `repo:surya-idp@334455734/<repo>@<repo_id>:ref:refs/heads/main`
(org since 2026-09-27; repo IDs survived the transfer).
- idp-github-ci, StringEquals: `feature-flag-service@1368152185`, `idp-portal@1389614591`.
- idp-service-ci, StringLike: `repo:surya-idp@334455734/*:ref:refs/heads/main` (user-approved
  exception; the role can only touch ECR `svc/*`).
- idp-infra-plan, StringEquals: `idp-infra@1381729533` main + `pull_request` (read-only plan, F7).
Renaming a repo changes `sub` (the name is in it): update the trust before pushing (Finding 50).

### GitHub Apps
| App | ID | Installed on | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `idp-ci-bot` (was ff-idp-ci-bot) | 5034584 | org surya-idp (All repositories for now; narrow to idp-gitops) | CI bumps; commits as `idp-ci-bot[bot]` (name from the token's app-slug). Secrets `FF_IDP_CI_BOT_APP_ID` / `FF_IDP_CI_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` in feature-flag-service and idp-portal (to be replaced by Image Updater) |
| `idp-backstage-surya` (was ff-idp-backstage; NOT "idp-backstage") | 5088974 (client Iv23lij5ChFBE8WFtPEH) | org surya-idp, All repositories | Backstage catalog + scaffolder + GitHub sign-in. Credentials in `~/.idp` (700/600), never in Git or TF state. Actions: read not granted yet (Step 31) |

Both Apps are owned by org surya-idp (transferred 2026-09-27; IDs, client ID and keys unchanged).
Both bypass the idp-gitops ruleset (bypass actors = these App IDs).

## 13. Real-World Findings and Gotchas

### From Steps 1-16 (Already in README)
1. p95 latency ~0.97s — not sub-50ms. Root cause: Postgres fetch ~780ms every request.
2. CrashLoopBackOff vs readiness failure — fail-fast startup bypasses probes.
3. Secret-template GitOps trap — Argo CD picks up any `kind: Secret` in watched path.
4. Kyverno optional-match `=(field)` bug — policy enforced nothing silently.
5. CRD size limit → `kubectl apply --server-side`.
6. Argo CD selfHeal fighting manual `kubectl apply`.
7. conntrack stickiness on sequential in-cluster requests (not yet in README).

### From Steps 17-22 (New Findings 2026-09-22)

**Finding 1: AWS rejects em-dashes in ALL description/GroupDescription fields**
- APIs affected: EC2 `CreateSecurityGroup` (`GroupDescription`), ElastiCache `CreateReplicationGroup` (`description`)
- Error: `InvalidParameterValue: Character sets beyond ASCII are not supported` (EC2) or `non-printable control characters` (ElastiCache)
- Rule: Use ASCII hyphens (-) ONLY in ALL description fields in ALL Terraform resources
- This applies to EVERY future resource with a description field

**Finding 2: ElastiCache has NO stop API**
- `aws elasticache stop-replication-group` — does not exist (invalid choice)
- Unlike RDS which has `stop-db-instance` (pauses compute, keeps storage)
- ElastiCache options: running ($0.016/hr) OR destroyed. Nothing in between.
- Consequence: Must live in 30-cluster (destroyed nightly), cannot live in 20-data
- $0.016/hr × 24 × 30 = $11.52/month if kept in 20-data with no stop

**Finding 3: RDS final snapshots accumulate silently**
- With `skip_final_snapshot = false`, every `terraform destroy` creates a snapshot
- 12 destroys/month × 20GB × $0.131/GB-month = $31.44/month in orphaned snapshots
- Check RDS Snapshots in console and delete manually if any exist from accidents
- Solution: `skip_final_snapshot = true` in ALL lab/portfolio RDS configs

**Finding 4: timestamp() causes permanent Terraform drift**
- `timestamp()` re-evaluates on every `terraform plan` → shows change every time
- Fix: `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [field_that_uses_timestamp] }`

**Finding 5: Python heredoc in Makefile requires tab on EVERY line**
- Multi-line Python inside a Makefile heredoc must have tab (not spaces) on each line
- Nearly impossible to maintain correctly → moved to `scripts/verify-empty.py`

**Finding 6: Dynamic OIDC thumbprint is critical**
- Do NOT hardcode the GitHub Actions OIDC thumbprint
- Use `tls_certificate` data source to fetch at apply time
- GitHub rotates their cert periodically — hardcoded thumbprint will break

**Finding 7: RDS console visibility**
- RDS instances only appear in the AWS console region selector for the region they were created in
- Must be on `ap-south-1` (Asia Pacific Mumbai) in the console to see idp-postgres
- After `terraform destroy 20-data`, the DB disappears — this is correct

### New Findings (Session 3 / Step 23)
**Finding 14: AWS Region Capacity Exhaustion:** `ap-south-1` completely ran out of `db.t4g.micro` and `gp3` combination capacity. Workaround applied: dropped back to x86 `db.t3.micro` and standard `gp2` storage.
**Finding 15: New-style Free Tier Spot Restrictions:** Recent AWS accounts aggressively block EC2 Spot instance requests for non-free-tier instance sizes (e.g., `t3.medium`). The API throws a misleading `InvalidParameterCombination` error. Workaround: Switch to `ON_DEMAND` or strictly use `t4g.small` / `t3.micro`.
**Finding 16: EKS Node Group Architecture Lock:** EKS Managed Node Groups strictly evaluate the underlying AMI architecture. If you request a Graviton (`t4g`) instance, you MUST explicitly override the default `ami_type` to `AL2023_ARM_64_STANDARD`. You cannot provide a fallback array mixing x86 and ARM sizes.
**Finding 17: AWS Tagging API Ghosting:** `aws resourcegroupstaggingapi` will confidently return ARNs for resources that cost $0 or are already destroyed. NAT Gateways linger for 1 hour after hitting the `"deleted"` state. KMS keys linger for the entirety of their mandatory 7-day `"PendingDeletion"` window. Scripts checking for billing leaks must query the active state (e.g., `describe-nat-gateways`), not just check for the ARN's existence.


### New Findings (Session 4 / Step 25)
**Finding 18: GitHub OIDC Thumbprint Drift:** The dynamic `tls_certificate` data source fetches the leaf certificate thumbprint, but AWS STS occasionally expects intermediate/root thumbprints, leading to `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` failures. Fix: Hardcode well-known AWS thumbprints alongside the dynamic one.
**Finding 19: CI Cross-Compilation Requirement (Exec Format Error):** EKS nodes (`t4g.small`) are ARM64, but GitHub Actions runner (`ubuntu-latest`) builds x86_64 images by default, causing `CrashLoopBackOff (exec format error)`. Fix: Updated CI to use `docker/setup-qemu-action` and `buildx` for `linux/arm64`.
**Finding 20: Missing Python Dependency Crash:** `20-data/main.tf` stored the DB URL as `postgresql+asyncpg://`, but the app uses synchronous SQLAlchemy (`create_engine`) with `psycopg2`. This caused a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'asyncpg'` crash on startup. **FIXED Session 5** (uncommitted): `20-data/main.tf` now emits `postgresql+psycopg2://`.
**Finding 21: EKS t4g.small ENI Pod Limit Exhaustion:** `t4g.small` nodes have a default max-pods limit of 11. ArgoCD, ESO, ALB Controller, and CoreDNS completely filled both nodes, causing API pods to be stuck in `Pending` (`Too many pods`). **FIXED Session 5** (uncommitted, untested on a live cluster): vpc-cni addon `ENABLE_PREFIX_DELEGATION=true` + `before_compute`, and node group `cloudinit_pre_nodeadm` sets kubelet `maxPods: 110`. VERIFY after next `make up`: `kubectl get node -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.allocatable.pods}'` should show 110.
**Finding 22: Out-of-band ALB blocks VPC Destruction:** ALBs created by the AWS Load Balancer Controller are not managed by Terraform. `make down` fails to destroy the VPC because the ALB is still attached to the subnets. **FIXED Session 5**: `scripts/down.sh` deletes Ingresses, then any leftover ALBs/target groups in the project VPC, before destroying layers.
**Finding 23: Non-empty ECR blocks make down:** `aws_ecr_repository` cannot be destroyed if it contains images. **FIXED Session 5**: `force_delete = true` on the ECR repo.

### New Findings (Session 5 - cost audit)
**Finding 24: Orphaned RDS final snapshot.** `idp-postgres-final-2026-09-22` (20GB, ~$2.62/mo) was left by the first destroy, before `skip_final_snapshot=true`. `make verify-empty` reported OK because the Tagging API does not surface it. Deleted manually 2026-09-26.
**Finding 25: Tag-based verification is not enough.** Snapshots, controller-created ALBs, ENIs and PVC volumes are not reliably visible via `resourcegroupstaggingapi`. `verify-empty.py` now ALSO queries each service directly (EKS, EC2, NAT, EIP, ELB, RDS + snapshots, ElastiCache, EBS + snapshots, Secrets, VPC endpoints, ECR, CloudWatch logs).
**Finding 26: `|| true` hid failed destroys.** `make down` now runs `scripts/down.sh`, which continues through all layers but exits non-zero and lists what failed. Never close the laptop on a non-zero exit.
**Finding 28: GitHub OIDC `sub` claim now embeds immutable IDs.** CI failed with "Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity" for days. CloudTrail (ap-south-1, `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`) showed the real subject: `repo:DSurya11@162597218/feature-flag-service@1368152185:ref:refs/heads/main`. The old `repo:OWNER/REPO:...` form (and a hand-made wildcard) never matched. Fixed in `00-bootstrap` with the exact new subject, no wildcard. The live role had also drifted from Terraform (console edit) - Terraform now owns it again. Debug tip: read the principal in the failed CloudTrail event.
**Finding 29: ECR must not live in a destroyed layer.** It was in 30-cluster, so each `make down` either failed (non-empty repo) or, with force_delete, wiped all images. Moved to permanent layer `15-registry` (NOT part of make up/down; apply once). CI pushes there.
**Finding 30: ALB controller was never installed by any code.** Session 4 must have installed it by hand. Now a `helm_release` in 40-platform (chart 3.5.0, IAM policy v3.5.0). ESO must depend on it: the controller's mutating webhook covers ALL Services, so installing anything in parallel fails with "no endpoints available".
**Finding 31: Prefix delegation works.** `vpc-cni` addon with `ENABLE_PREFIX_DELEGATION` + `before_compute`, plus kubelet `maxPods: 110` via `cloudinit_pre_nodeadm`: both nodes report 110 allocatable pods (was 11).
**Finding 32: Trivy could not scan the pushed image.** buildx pushes without loading into the local daemon, and the image is arm64 on an amd64 runner. Fix: `TRIVY_USERNAME/PASSWORD` from `aws ecr get-login-password`, `TRIVY_PLATFORM=linux/arm64`, and `--provenance=false` on the build.
**Finding 33: The CI bot could not update env-config - FIXED 2026-09-26.** The `ff-idp-ci-bot` GitHub App existed but had 0 installations (`GET /app` showed `installations_count: 0`; token minting returned 404). Installed on `idp-gitops` only; verified by an empty-commit CI run: all 3 jobs green and `ff-idp-ci-bot[bot]` committed the new SHA. Diagnostic that works: sign an app JWT with the private key and call `GET /app/installations` (never print the key).
**Finding 34: Fresh RDS has no schema; the app does not migrate itself.** AUTOMATED and VERIFIED LIVE 2026-09-26: `eks-db-migrate-job.yaml` in env-config is an Argo CD Sync-hook Job (`alembic upgrade head`) on sync-wave 1; the Deployment is wave 2; ExternalSecret/namespace wave 0. Evidence: job ran `initial_schema` and completed 13:12:39Z, API pods created 13:12:39-40Z (after), `/health` 200 and flag create/evaluate work with no manual alembic. A second sync re-ran the Job as a no-op (already at head) and did not restart the API pods. CI bumps the image in both `eks-api-deployment.yaml` and `eks-db-migrate-job.yaml`. Fallback by hand: `kubectl exec -n feature-flag-dev deploy/feature-flag-api -- sh -c "cd /app; alembic upgrade head"`.
**Finding 36: Tag API ghosts purged NAT gateways.** ~1h after deletion AWS purges a NAT gateway, but `resourcegroupstaggingapi` still lists its ARN and `describe-nat-gateways --nat-gateway-ids` fails with `NatGatewayNotFound`. `verify-empty.py` treated that as billable (false alarm, make down exited non-zero). Fixed: NotFound = free. The direct service checks were empty the whole time.
**Finding 37: An interrupted `make down` leaves billable resources.** A teardown that was cut off (session/process ended) left the NAT gateway, its EIP and RDS running (~$0.09/hr) while EKS and Valkey were already gone. `make down` is idempotent: just re-run it. After ANY interruption, run `make verify-empty` (or query EKS/NAT/RDS directly) before closing the laptop. Do not start `make down` and walk away from the session.
**Finding 35: Argo root app YAML bug.** `syncOptions` must be under `spec.syncPolicy`, not `spec`. Root app is manual-sync and scoped by `directory.include` to the EKS manifests until Step 27.
**Finding 38: Argo CD v2.13 vs Kubernetes 1.35 schema skew.** With `ServerSideApply=true`, Argo's structured-merge diff fails on the live Deployment: `.status.terminatingReplicas: field not declared in schema` (field added in k8s 1.33). Sync status goes `Unknown` and auto-sync silently stops; the FIRST sync works (nothing live to diff), so it only shows on the second deploy. Workaround: no ServerSideApply on `feature-flag-dev`. Real fix (TODO): upgrade the Argo CD chart (7.7.3 = v2.13, tested only to k8s ~1.31) to a release that supports 1.35.
**Finding 39: selfHeal vs teardown.** With automated sync + selfHeal, deleting the Ingress in `make down` would just be recreated. `down.sh` now deletes the `root` Application first; finalizers cascade root -> children -> resources, so the Ingress (and the ALB, via the still-running controller) is gone before Terraform runs. Verified: ALB list empty before 40-platform destroy.
**Finding 40: App-of-apps needs an Application health check.** Argo CD 1.8+ reports no health for Application resources, so child sync waves are not waited on. 40-platform adds the upstream `resource.customizations.health.argoproj.io_Application` Lua. Verified: platform-cluster (wave 0) synced 14:45:57, feature-flag-dev (wave 1) created 14:45:59.
**Finding 41: HPA in an early sync wave deadlocks Argo CD v3.** Argo CD v3 health-checks HPAs; one whose target Deployment does not exist yet is Degraded. In wave 0 (default) it blocked the wave-2 Deployment forever ("unable to get the target's current scale ... not found", sync retrying). Fix: HPA and PDB on wave 3, after the Deployment.
**Finding 42: EKS metrics-server add-on needs port 10251 open.** The terraform-aws-modules/eks node SG allows cluster->node only on 443/4443/6443/8443/9443/10250; the add-on serves on 10251. Symptom: pods Running but `kubectl top` says "Metrics API not available", APIService "failing or missing response ... :10251 context deadline exceeded", HPA shows `<unknown>`. Fix: `node_security_group_additional_rules` for 10251 from the cluster SG.
**Finding 43: Argo CD upgraded 7.7.3 (v2.13) -> chart 10.9.2 (v3.5.3).** Fresh install each session, so no in-place migration. Dropped `application.namespaces` from argocd-cm (it belongs in cmd-params, and was unused). ServerSideApply stays off on feature-flag-dev (not needed; SSA was not re-tested on v3).
**Finding 44: Preemption ignores PodDisruptionBudgets (Step 28).** First drain test under load: 105/14258 requests failed (502/503/504 in a ~10s window). Isolated by re-running each event alone with per-failure logging: rolling restart alone = 0 failures; steady state = 0; drain with no API pod on the node = 0; drain of the node holding an API pod = 82 failures. Events showed `Preempted by pod ...` on BOTH API replicas: after the drain, everything had to fit on one t4g.small (memory requests 82%), a system-cluster-critical pod (ebs-csi-controller) could not schedule, and the scheduler preempted the lowest-priority pods - the API, at priority 0. PDBs only govern evictions, not preemption. Fixes: (1) `business-critical` PriorityClass (1e6) for the API, (2) zone topology spread, (3) realistic node replacement = surge a node first (what EKS managed node group updates do), not drain with zero headroom. Root cause is capacity: 2x 2GiB nodes cannot absorb a whole node. Also: ebs-csi-controller runs 2 replicas x 6 containers and nothing uses EBS yet - a candidate to remove to free memory.
**Finding 45: Step 28 proof (final run).** Under 20 rps constant k6 load through the ALB: GitOps rollout (push -> Argo) + node group surge 2->3 + drain of a node holding an API pod: **28,800 requests, 0 failed, p95 43.8 ms**. The drain logged "Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget" x5 - the PDB held the second replica until its replacement was Ready. HPA burst (150 iterations/s = 300 req/s): CPU 26% -> 329% of request, scaled 3 -> 4 (max) in ~30 s, **53,602 requests, 0 failed, p95 73 ms**. Mechanisms: maxUnavailable 0 / maxSurge 1, ALB pod readiness gate (namespace label), preStop sleep 20s > ALB deregistration delay 10s, PDB minAvailable 1, HPA owns replicas (none in Git). Reproduce: `tests/rollout-load.js` (logs every failure with timestamp + status).
**Finding 46: Backstage image failed the Trivy gate - 27 HIGH/CRITICAL, none in app code.** Sources: (a) the node base image's global npm (bundled tar/brace-expansion/ip-address) - npm is never used at runtime, so the Dockerfile now deletes npm/npx; (b) tar 6.2.1 under node-gyp 10 + cacache (18 findings; fixes exist only in tar 7) - the scaffold pins node-gyp ^10, bumped to ^13 (tar ^7, no cacache); (c) protobufjs 7.5.5 via @google-cloud/firestore - `yarn up -R protobufjs` -> 7.6.6. Result: Trivy clean. Lesson: read the file PATH in Trivy output before touching dependencies - most findings were in tooling the app never loads.
**Finding 47: RDS PostgreSQL 16 enforces SSL (rds.force_ssl=1).** psycopg2 negotiates SSL by default (the API just works); Node's `pg` does not. Backstage config sets `ssl.ca` to the bundled RDS global CA (verified TLS, not rejectUnauthorized:false).
**Finding 48: Duplicate GitHub Actions runs + immutable ECR tags.** GitHub started two runs for one push; the second failed pushing the same immutable tag. idp-portal CI now has `concurrency: ci-${{ github.sha }}` with cancel-in-progress. feature-flag-service CI has the same latent issue (and "Re-run" of a green build would also fail on the immutable tag). FIXED 2026-09-27 in both repos: concurrency per event+SHA, "image already in ECR" check (re-runs skip the push), and a rebase-and-retry loop for the bot push to idp-gitops (several CI bots now push there). feature-flag-service build also moved to the native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner (no QEMU).
**Finding 49: Terraform state was never locked.** The DynamoDB lock table existed, but no backend referenced it (`dynamodb_table` was only in this doc's example), so two concurrent applies could have corrupted state. Found during the rename migration. All backends now set `use_lockfile = true` (S3-native lock, TF >= 1.10; `dynamodb_table` is deprecated). Verified: a second concurrent plan fails with "Error acquiring the state lock".
**Finding 50: Renaming a "permanent" layer is a state migration, not a find-and-replace.** S3 buckets and security groups cannot be renamed; IAM roles are replaced. Done as: `state rm` old bucket/table (kept as backup) -> apply new -> `s3 sync` state -> `init -reconfigure` per layer -> no-change plans prove code == AWS. The GitHub OIDC `sub` claim contains the repo NAME, so renaming a repo breaks CI until the trust policy matches (IDs are stable, names are not).
**Finding 51: Neon retired.** The Step 21 A/B was the only reason to keep the Neon project (Step 11, `90-legacy-neon`). With the result recorded (section 16a: p95 ~970 ms -> ~20 ms), the project was destroyed and the layer, its tfvars (Neon API key) and `make neon-plan` removed. Nothing deployed ever read from Neon after Step 21 (DATABASE_URL comes from idp/db-creds = RDS).
**Finding 56: Transferring a repo to an org silently drops security settings and ruleset bypass actors.** After moving the 4 repos to surya-idp (2026-09-27): secret scanning, push protection and CodeQL default setup were all back to disabled, and the idp-gitops ruleset kept its rules but lost its App bypass list (bot pushes to main would have been rejected). Repo IDs, secrets, rulesets, PRs and Dependabot config survived. Re-enabled/restored immediately; verified with a real CI bot push (dfb88f3, 6728c5e). Checklist for any transfer: re-check `security_and_analysis`, code-scanning default setup and each ruleset's `bypass_actors`.
**Finding 27: Spend audit.** As of 2026-09-26, ~$1 of credits used over 3 sessions, consistent with the ~$0.73/session model. Cost Explorer lags ~24h and shows ~$0; use Billing > Credits for the real balance. All regions checked empty.

### Sync Policy by Environment
| Environment | Sync | Gate |

| staging | Automated | Promotion PR required |
| prod | Manual sync | Deliberate human action required |

---

## 15. Secrets Strategy (Steps 21 + 24)

### Secrets Manager Entries
| Secret Name | Contents | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| `idp/db-creds` | password, url | ESO → K8s Secret → app |
| `idp/jwt-secret` | JWT_SECRET_KEY | ESO → K8s Secret → app |
| `idp/grafana-admin` | admin-password | ESO → K8s Secret → Grafana |
| `idp/backstage-github-app` | GitHub App private key, app ID | ESO → K8s Secret → Backstage |

### ESO Pattern
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: feature-flag-secrets
  namespace: feature-flag-dev
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secrets-manager
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: feature-flag-secrets
  data:
    - secretKey: DATABASE_URL
      remoteRef:
        key: idp/db-creds
        property: url
    - secretKey: JWT_SECRET_KEY
      remoteRef:
        key: idp/jwt-secret
        property: JWT_SECRET_KEY
```

Why ESO matters: No `kind: Secret` exists in Git at all. Structurally eliminates the secret-template GitOps trap from Step 13.

### Verification (NEVER echo plaintext)
```bash
kubectl get secret feature-flag-secrets -n feature-flag-dev \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.JWT_SECRET_KEY}' | base64 -d | sha256sum
# Compare hashes before/after rotation — never compare plaintext values
```

## 16. The Latency Story (A/B Experiment — Step 21)

### Current Finding (Step 16, Neon)
- p95: ~0.97s
- Redis: ~0.6ms (fast)
- Postgres fetch: ~780ms (slow — every request)
- Neon pooled endpoint used
- Root cause NOT isolated

### A/B Experiment Plan (do after Step 23 cluster is up)
- One variable changed: Neon over WAN → RDS in same VPC as pods
- Same code, same timing instrumentation (`time.perf_counter()` in `app/evaluation.py`)
- Same test: burst of /evaluate requests, check p95 from Prometheus histogram
- Keep Neon alive until this test is done (done 2026-09-26; Neon retired 2026-09-27)

### Possible Outcomes
| Result | Conclusion |
|---|---|
| p95 collapses to <10ms | Root cause was WAN RTT / TLS / Neon pooler hop |
| p95 stays high | Root cause is SQLAlchemy session/pool handling → add OpenTelemetry (Step 34) |

---

## 16a. Step 21 A/B RESULT (measured 2026-09-26, RDS in VPC, same code)
| Path | Neon over WAN (Step 16) | RDS in VPC, server-side (in-pod) | Via ALB from laptop |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/evaluate` p95 | ~970 ms | 20 ms (DB miss) / 30 ms (Redis hit) | ~58 ms |
DB miss p50 8.3 ms vs Redis hit p50 3.9 ms => Postgres fetch ~4 ms. ~48 ms floor via ALB = laptop-to-ALB RTT (`/health` identical). Conclusion: WAN RTT/TLS/pooler was the root cause, NOT SQLAlchemy session handling. Caveat: cluster also changed (kind -> EKS); the DB location is the dominant change. Reproduce: `test_latency.py` (header explains in-pod vs ALB modes). Neon (90-legacy-neon) is no longer needed for the experiment.

---

## 16c. Measured timings (2026-09-26, clean runs, ap-south-1)
| Operation | Time |
|---|---|
| `make up` (20-data + 30-cluster + 40-platform), first-try clean run | **26.6 min** (1596 s): RDS ~10 min, cluster ~10 min, platform ~6 min |
| Sync -> API serving through ALB (incl. migration) | ~1 min after ALB provisioning |
| `make down`, clean run | **16.4 min** (981 s); slowest steps: EKS node group drain, then control plane |
Build+teardown overhead is ~43 min of billing (~$0.20) even for a 5-minute test.

---

## 16b. Next Session Checklist
Steps 23-27 are VERIFIED. A session is now: `make up` -> everything deploys itself -> work -> `make down`.
1. `aws sso login --profile idp`, then `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile idp` (SSO role, not an IAM user), check `curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com` matches `allowed_cidr` in 30-cluster/variables.tf, then `make up` (~21-27 min). It waits for the root app to be Healthy.
2. Check: `kubectl get applications -n argocd` all Synced/Healthy; ALB: `kubectl get ingress -n feature-flag-dev`.
3. No manual secret or migration steps any more (JWT generated, alembic Job automatic).
4. Open Backstage: `kubectl port-forward svc/idp-portal -n backstage 7007:7007` -> http://localhost:7007 (guest sign-in).
4a. (DONE 2026-09-27) BEFORE `make up` (manual, user): (1) `terraform -chdir=10-network apply` -> exactly 2 in-place changes (public subnets map_public_ip_on_launch -> false). (2) For PR idp-infra#10: `git checkout ci/terraform-plan`, `terraform -chdir=00-bootstrap plan` -> exactly 2 to add (role idp-infra-plan + its policy), apply, back to main, then mark #10 ready and merge.
4c. Manual, user (after the org migration): (1) `terraform -chdir=00-bootstrap plan` -> exactly 3 to change (only `-` DSurya11 lines in github_ci, service_ci, infra_plan), then apply (PR #14 is merged). (2) https://github.com/organizations/surya-idp/settings/installations -> idp-ci-bot -> Configure -> "Only select repositories": idp-gitops. (3) https://github.com/settings/installations (personal account): uninstall any leftover idp-ci-bot / idp-backstage-surya installation. (4) After ~2026-10-04: delete the inactive idp-admin access key + `~/.aws/credentials.disabled` / `.bak`.
4b. Merge the draft PRs in this ORDER, then `make up` (all under github.com/surya-idp/...): idp-infra#8 (bootstrap AppProject) -> idp-infra#9 + idp-gitops#5 (ESO 2.11.0 + v1, together) -> idp-gitops#4 (AppProjects + PSA; locks `default`) -> idp-portal#6 (template). Each PR body lists its verification commands. If anything breaks, revert that PR in idp-gitops (through a PR) and re-sync.
5. NEXT WORK: TEMPLATES_RESEARCH.md phase 1 (zero-touch dev delivery), then phases 2-4. Step 30 demo is done (section 17). Backstage: sign in with GitHub (not guest) to run templates. `hello-svc` (the 2026-09-27 demo) was deleted by user decision; the next demo service comes from template v2.
6. The first `make up` on the new bucket succeeded (2026-09-27): the old backups `ff-idp-tfstate-693906847772` (versioned: delete all versions) and `ff-idp-tf-locks` can be deleted.
7. `make down` must exit 0 and you must SEE it finish (Finding 37). Re-run it if interrupted.

### PHASE B — Cluster (Cost Starts)

#### Step 23 — EKS Cluster (30-cluster) — DONE (original spec below)

File to create: `/home/surya/projects/idp-infra/30-cluster/main.tf`

**BEFORE STARTING:** Verify EKS version support:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html
- Standard support = $0.10/hr. Extended support = $0.60/hr. DO NOT use extended.
- As of 2026-09-22, versions 1.28-1.32 are in standard support (verify before creating)

```hcl

```

Measure build time: `time terraform apply -auto-approve` from start to `kubectl get nodes Ready`
This is your "mean time to environment" metric for the README.

**Verify:**
```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
# Must show 2 nodes in DIFFERENT AZs with PRIVATE IPs

aws eks describe-cluster --name idp-cluster --profile idp --query 'cluster.version'
# Must match standard-support version

# After Step 23, full green CI run will work — ECR repo now exists
```

---

#### Step 24 — External Secrets Operator + IRSA — DONE (original spec below)

```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "eso" {
  statement {
    actions   = ["secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"]
    resources = [
      # Specific secret ARNs — NOT "*"
      "arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-south-1:693906847772:secret:idp/*"
    ]
  }
}
```

**ClusterSecretStore:**
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterSecretStore
metadata:
  name: aws-secrets-manager
spec:
  provider:
    aws:
      service: SecretsManager
      region: ap-south-1
      auth:
        jwt:
          serviceAccountRef:
            name: external-secrets
            namespace: external-secrets
```

**Verify:**
```bash
kubectl delete secret feature-flag-secrets -n feature-flag-dev
sleep 60
kubectl get secret feature-flag-secrets -n feature-flag-dev
# Must exist again (ESO recreated it)

# Secret rotation test (never echo plaintext — compare hashes)
kubectl get secret feature-flag-secrets -n feature-flag-dev \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.JWT_SECRET_KEY}' | base64 -d | sha256sum
# Rotate in Secrets Manager console, wait refreshInterval
kubectl get secret feature-flag-secrets -n feature-flag-dev \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.JWT_SECRET_KEY}' | base64 -d | sha256sum
# Hashes must differ
```

---

#### Step 25 — Ingress: ALB Controller + No-Domain Setup — DONE (original spec below)

**ONE shared ALB via IngressGroup (not three separate ALBs):**
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: idp
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
```

**Verify:**
```bash
curl -sI http://<alb-dns>/health
# HTTP/1.1 200

aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --profile idp \
  --query 'LoadBalancers[?contains(LoadBalancerName, `idp`)].LoadBalancerArn'
# Must show EXACTLY ONE ALB for all environments
```

---

### PHASE C — GitOps Properly

#### Steps 26 + 27 - DONE and VERIFIED 2026-09-26
- Root Application (40-platform, automated) -> `platform/argocd-apps/` -> `platform-cluster` (wave 0, ClusterSecretStore) + `feature-flag-dev` (wave 1, `apps/feature-flag-service/overlays/dev`, automated prune+selfHeal).
- env-config is Kustomize: `apps/feature-flag-service/base` + `overlays/{dev,staging,prod}`. staging/prod are defined but NOT deployed (need own DB, distinct ingress rule, more nodes - see their kustomization.yaml). Kind-era manifests deleted (in git history). Kyverno policy parked in `platform/kyverno/` (not synced until Kyverno is installed).
- JWT key is generated by 20-data each session (no manual step).
- Verified: `make up` alone -> app live, migration ran, ALB 200, zero manual syncs. Full GitOps chain: empty commit -> CI green -> bot bumps `overlays/dev` newTag -> Argo auto-rolls out the new SHA (~9 min push-to-running incl. CI; Argo polls every 3 min).
- Deviations from the original plan: Argo CD installs ESO and the ALB controller via Terraform, not Argo (bootstrap order; revisit later). No ApplicationSet yet (one env live - an ApplicationSet is worth it when staging goes live).

#### Step 26 — Argo CD via Terraform + App-of-Apps (original plan)
Terraform installs Argo CD ONLY. Argo CD installs everything else.
Sync wave order: 0=ESO, 1=ALB Controller, 2=Kyverno, 3=Prometheus+metrics-server, 4=Apps.

#### Step 27 — Multi-Environment env-config Restructure
See Section 14 for target structure. Pause Argo CD auto-sync during restructure.
Promotion: dev auto-deploys → staging PR → prod manual sync.

#### Step 28 - DONE and VERIFIED 2026-09-26 (see Findings 41, 42, 44, 45)
Zero failed requests across GitOps rollout + node surge + drain; HPA scale-out verified.

#### Step 28 — HPA + PDB + Rolling Update Proof (original plan)
k6 load during rolling update. Zero failed requests required.

---

### PHASE D — The Actual IDP

#### Step 29 - Backstage in cluster: DONE and VERIFIED (2026-09-27)
Verified live: `make up` alone deployed it (Argo `idp-portal` Synced/Healthy); Ready ~30s after start; catalog DB migrations ran on RDS over verified TLS; via port-forward: UI HTTP 200, `/.backstage/health/v1/readiness` ok, guest sign-in ok; catalog contains `feature-flag-service` (owner DSurya11) + resources feature-flag-postgres / feature-flag-redis, read live from GitHub. Node memory after removing EBS CSI and adding Backstage: 52-57% used. Expected warnings: kubernetes plugin unconfigured (Step 31), permissions disabled.
- Repo: github.com/surya-idp/idp-portal (public; native ubuntu-24.04-arm runners, ~3 min build). CI: install/tsc/build -> arm64 image -> ECR `idp-portal` (15-registry, keep 5) via the same OIDC role (exact subject added) -> Trivy gate -> ff-idp-ci-bot bumps `apps/idp-portal/overlays/dev`.
- env-config: `apps/idp-portal` (namespace `backstage`, 1 replica, 512Mi request / 1Gi limit, DB creds from idp/db-creds via ESO), Argo Application `idp-portal` (wave 1).
- ACCESS: NO Ingress. `kubectl port-forward svc/idp-portal -n backstage 7007:7007` -> http://localhost:7007. Reason: Backstage needs a fixed baseUrl and the ALB hostname changes every session; guest sign-in is acceptable only while unexposed. User asked for "only me" access - port-forward is stricter than an IP allowlist.
- Capacity: EBS CSI add-on removed (unused; freed memory for Backstage).
- Deferred to Step 30: GitHub App for Backstage (catalog reads of public repos need no token).

#### Step 29 — Backstage in Cluster (original plan)
- Containerize idp-portal (multi-stage, non-root)
- Second DATABASE on same RDS instance (`CREATE DATABASE backstage_db`)
- Replace GitHub PAT with GitHub App, store in idp/backstage-github-app secret

#### Step 30 - Software Templates: LIVE DEMO DONE (2026-09-27, `hello-svc`)
Form submit -> `http://<ALB>/hello-svc/` 200 in **5m31s** (06:40:47Z -> 06:46:18Z), of which ~3.5 min
was a human waiting to merge. Machine time ~2 min: scaffolder 17 s (repo, idp-gitops PR, catalog),
new repo CI green 1m12s (image in ECR `svc/hello-svc`), merge -> first 200 in 36 s (Argo refresh
forced; otherwise up to +3 min poll). Verified: 2 pods uid 10001, PriorityClass business-critical,
HPA 2-3, PDB minAvailable 1, Argo `hello-svc` Synced/Healthy, catalog component `hello-svc`.
- Finding 52: publish:github with the App's installation token fails "Resource not accessible by
  integration": POST /user/repos accepts only user tokens (App user token or PAT), never an
  installation token. Fixed (idp-portal cb1f197): GitHub sign-in via the App's OAuth client
  (redirect URI http://localhost:7007/api/auth/github/handler/frame, resolver
  usernameMatchingUserEntityName, User DSurya11 in examples/org.yaml), RepoUrlPicker
  requestUserCredentials -> publish:github `token: secrets.USER_OAUTH_TOKEN`. The idp-gitops PR
  still goes through the App. Task runs as user:default/dsurya11.
- Finding 53: templates now load from ONE Location `idp-portal/templates/all-templates.yaml`
  (new template = add a target + git push, no image rebuild). Nested Location targets do not
  inherit per-location `rules`, so `Template` is in the global `catalog.rules`.
- Finding 54: the first pod of a brand-new service has no ALB readiness gate: the webhook injects
  it only when the TargetGroupBinding already exists at pod creation. Pods from later rollouts get it.
- Finding 55: the generated CI builds and pushes on every main push but nothing updates
  idp-gitops afterwards, so a generated service stays on its first commit forever. The merge is
  also manual, which contradicts section 14 (dev auto-deploys). Target design and plan:
  TEMPLATES_RESEARCH.md sections 4 and 8.
- GitHub App `ff-idp-backstage` (App ID 5088974, installed on ALL repos of DSurya11; administration/contents/workflows/pull_requests write). Actions:read not granted yet (needed for Step 31).
- Credentials live on the laptop in `~/.idp/` (700/600): `backstage-app.env` (APP_ID, CLIENT_ID), `backstage-app.pem`, `backstage-client-secret`. `make up` runs `scripts/load-local-secrets.sh` -> idp/backstage-github-app (stdin only; keeps $0 idle vs $0.40/mo permanent secret) -> ESO -> Backstage env.
- Template `idp-portal/templates/python-service` (loaded from GitHub URL): fetch skeleton -> publish:github (public repo) -> render env-config slice pinned to `steps.publish.output.commitHash` -> publish:github:pull-request -> catalog:register.
- Generated repo CI uses role `idp-service-ci`: trust `repo:DSurya11@162597218/*` main only, ECR `svc/*` only (creates its repo on first run). Deliberate exception to the exact-subject rule (user decision).
- Golden path bakes in Step 28: maxUnavailable 0, preStop 20s, readiness gate, PDB, HPA (wave 3), PriorityClass, zone spread, non-root uid 10001, uvicorn keep-alive 75s > ALB 60s. Route: `/<name>` on the shared ALB (group.order 10; feature-flag-api catch-all moved to 1000).
- Skeleton verified locally: renders, builds, serves /health and /<name>/, uid 10001, Trivy clean (after pinning starlette 1.7.0 - fastapi 0.118 pulled starlette 0.48 with 3 HIGH).

#### Step 30 — Software Templates (The Whole Point) (original plan)
**Template 1:** `create-python-service` — new repo + CI + env-config PR + catalog register
**Template 2:** `add-feature-flag` — domain-specific golden path

**⭐ Headline demo:** Fill form → repo created → CI green → PR in env-config → merge → service deployed via ALB → appears in catalog. Time it. Put duration in README.

#### Step 31 — Backstage Plugins
Argo CD, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Grafana, TechDocs (S3 backed)

---

### PHASE E — Hardening

#### Step 33 — Extended Kyverno Policy Suite
5 new policies: require-resource-limits, restrict-image-registries (ECR only), require-labels, disallow-latest-tag, require-probes

#### Step 34 — Observability
Alerting: PrometheusRule → Alertmanager → Slack/Discord webhook (induce each alert, paste received notification)
Logs: Loki + promtail (cheaper than CloudWatch Container Insights)
Traces: OpenTelemetry → Tempo (resolves the Step 16 latency mystery)

#### Step 35 — DR Drill
```bash
time make nuke    # full destroy with final snapshot
time make up      # full rebuild
./tests/test_e2e.sh  # N/N checks pass
```
Mean time to full environment from zero → in README.

#### Step 36 — Rewrite test_e2e.sh for AWS/EKS
EKS context check, ALB DNS + HTTP 200, RDS from pod, ESO ExternalSecret=Ready, all 3 envs, Argo CD sync status, ECR scan (no HIGH/CRITICAL), 5 Kyverno policies, Prometheus target UP.

## 18. README Additions Still Needed

Add to Section 3 "Real Engineering Decisions":
8. conntrack stickiness on sequential in-cluster requests
9. NAT Gateway vs NAT instance vs VPC endpoints — arithmetic, chosen approach
10. SPOT node groups with multi-instance-type fallback — fewer interruptions
11. Terraform bootstraps Argo CD; Argo CD owns everything else — two reconcilers fighting is a real failure mode
12. ESO structurally eliminates the secret-template GitOps trap — design vs. symptom fix
13. Prod on manual sync; dev/staging auto-sync — deliberate
14. One shared ALB via IngressGroup — three ALBs = three times the hourly charge
15. The latency resolution — Neon-over-internet vs RDS-in-VPC, same code, one variable changed
16. ElastiCache has no stop API — why Valkey lives in 30-cluster not 20-data (new finding)
17. Option B lifecycle — full destroy every session, $0.00 idle, why it's better than stopping (new)
18. skip_final_snapshot = true — why it's non-negotiable for destroy-based lifecycle (new)
19. AWS em-dash rejection — non-ASCII in resource descriptions causes API errors (new)
20. Dynamic OIDC thumbprint — hardcoded thumbprints break when GitHub rotates cert (new)
21. **Region Capacity Engineering:** How we gracefully degraded from ARM/gp3 to x86/gp2 when AWS Mumbai ran out of hardware dynamically during `make up`.
22. **Spot Restrictions & AMI Types:** Understanding that cost-saving with Spot instances on new AWS accounts is tightly coupled to Free Tier guardrails, and how EKS forces architectural lock-in (ARM vs x86) at the Node Group AMI layer.
23. **API Ghosting in Verification Scripts:** The complexity of writing a "zero-cost verification" script that must navigate the AWS Tagging API's aggressive caching of deleted NAT Gateways and pending-deletion KMS keys.
24. **OIDC Thumbprint Instability:** Why relying purely on dynamic TLS certificate thumbprints for GitHub Actions OIDC fails, and why well-known static thumbprints are required as fallbacks.
25. **The ENI Pod Limit Trap:** Why `t4g.small` EKS nodes cap out at 11 pods by default, how system pods (ArgoCD, ESO, ALB Controller) easily consume this limit, and the necessity of VPC CNI Prefix Delegation.

Add "Cost Engineering" section:
- Per-hour table from verified AWS Pricing API data
- Option B vs Option A comparison
- Mean time to environment (measure in Step 23)

Add "Self-Service" section:
- Backstage template demo with measured developer-to-running-service time

Update "Known Simplifications":
- REMOVE: Secrets applied imperatively (fixed by ESO)
- REMOVE: No Ingress (fixed by ALB Controller)
- ADD: Single-AZ RDS (no Multi-AZ)
- ADD: No service mesh
- ADD: SPOT-only nodes (no on-demand fallback)
- ADD: No paid domain — HTTP only via ALB DNS
- ADD: Option B lifecycle — data not persistent between sessions

## 19. Interview Stories (Per Step)

Strongest stories in order:
1. **Step 30** — "developer to running service in X minutes, zero platform-team involvement"
2. **Step 21** — latency A/B: one variable changed, real data
3. **Step 24** — ESO structurally eliminates the GitOps trap class
4. **Step 35** — destroy and rebuild the entire platform every session; mean time: X minutes
5. **Step 15** — Kyverno optional-match bug (testing policy works ≠ testing policy enforces)
6. **Step 13** — secret-template GitOps trap (real, non-obvious failure mode)
7. **Step 16** — p95 0.97s discovery (data overturning untested assumption)
8. **Step 21+** — ElastiCache no-stop-API discovery; architecture decision explained by arithmetic
9. **Step 22** — Zero long-lived credentials in CI (OIDC + GitHub App = no static secrets)

## 20. Things That Must Never Happen

- Never operate as AWS root
- Never echo plaintext secret values — use SHA256 checksums
- Never leave EKS running unattended — make down before closing laptop, make verify-empty must pass
- Never use `Resource: "*"` in IAM policies for ESO or any scoped role
- Never use wildcards in OIDC trust policy (single approved exception: idp-service-ci, owner-ID scoped, ECR svc/* only)
- Never use engine="redis" — use engine="valkey"
- Never hardcode OIDC thumbprint — use tls_certificate data source
- Never use em-dashes in AWS resource description fields — use ASCII hyphens
- Never set skip_final_snapshot=false on RDS with Option B lifecycle — $31/month snapshots
- Never drop the `terraform plan` → "No changes" check after state migrations
- Never claim a step is done without real command output as evidence
- Never assume ElastiCache can be stopped — it cannot, it must be destroyed
- Never mix ARM (t4g) and x86 (t3) instance types in the same EKS Managed Node Group.
- Never forget `force_delete = true` on ECR repositories intended for ephemeral lab teardown.
- Never rely solely on dynamic OIDC thumbprints without static fallbacks for GitHub Actions.
- Never deploy heavy system components (ArgoCD, ESO) to `t4g.small` nodes without VPC CNI Prefix Delegation enabled.
- Never add a Terraform backend without `use_lockfile = true` (state was silently unlocked until Finding 49).
- Never rename a GitHub repo that CI uses without updating the OIDC trust `sub` first.
- Never put GitHub App secrets or private keys in Git, chat or TF state; they live in `~/.idp`.
