# 10-network/main.tf
#
# Network layer — VPC, subnets, security groups.
# Uses the local modules/vpc module.
#
# COST: $0 — VPC, subnets, route tables, IGW, and security groups are free.
# LIFECYCLE: Keep up permanently. Destroying costs nothing and requires
#   rebuilding 20-data, 30-cluster, and 40-platform as well.
#
# NAT GATEWAY: NOT in this layer. NAT lives in 30-cluster so it is destroyed
# nightly with the cluster. This is the key cost decision:
#   NAT Gateway = $0.056/hr = $1.34/day = $40/month if left running.
#   By putting it in 30-cluster, NAT is only alive during active sessions.
